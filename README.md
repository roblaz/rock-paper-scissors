Homework for 03.10.18.

Create rock-paper-scissors game. The app should have a logo page, because every cool game has one. The user should be able to input their name, which will be later displayed with their game score in a list on the score page. How you create your application is up to you, whether you use ListView to display your scores, use buttons to move to other pages in the app or a menu instead. Try to use everything that we have covered so far in the lessons. The cooler the app is the better, don't limit yourself.
